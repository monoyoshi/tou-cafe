                    tou café's core mission: to be a reliable database for nut-free recipes.<br>

                        Have you ever wanted to eat something that looks delicious, only to find out it was made with nuts in some way? Does your body ever hate nuts so much that it would rather die than consume one? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then you're in luck! As someone with severe nut allergies, I am forced to pass up on mouth-watering food every single day of my life. Chocolate? Contains nuts. Cookies? Traces of nuts present. Cake? Manufactured in a facility that processes nuts. And guess what? I got tired of it, so I started tou café (the lowercase makes it chill). The purpose of tou café is to help those with nut allergies easily find recipes they can eat.<br>

                        No actually, tou café was originally a high school project of mine back when I was really obsessed with the Touken Ranbu/刀剣乱舞 franchise. One of my biggest assignments in my graphic design course was to create a branding for a hypothetical café, so I did what my silly autism brain did best and made the groundwork for some sort of sword-themed coffee shop. Many years later, and I'm now pretty good at building websites and making banana bread. The nut-free bit still stands, though.<br>

                    <br>
                    <p>I do want tou café to be more than a recipe database one day, so who knows?</p>

                        Some guy who lives in the void. They made banana bread once and instantly rizzed everyone that ate it. They're also good at making websites on the fly (allegedly).<br>
