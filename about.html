                        have you ever wanted to eat something seen in an advertisement, only to find out it was made with nuts in some way? does your body ever hate nuts so much that it would rather die than eat another one? if you answered yes to these questions, then same! you aren't alone. as someone with severe nut allergies, I am forced to pass up on mouth-watering food every single day of my life. chocolate? contains nuts. cookies? contains traces of nuts. cake? manufactured in a facility that processes nuts. and guess what? i got tired of it, so I started tou café. tou café's purpose is to help those with nut allergies find recipes of cool foods that they can eat.<br><br>

                        ok i lied tou café was originally a high school project of mine back when I was really obsessed with the touken ranbu franchise. one of my big assignments in my graphic design course was to create a branding for a café, so i did what my autism brain did best and made the groundwork for some sort of branding. many years later, and I'm now pretty good at making banana bread and also building websites on the fly. the nut-free mission still stands, though.
