                    <p>Have you ever wanted to eat something that looks delicious, only to find out it was made with nuts in some way? Does your body ever hate nuts so much that it would rather die than consume one? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then you're in luck! As someone with severe nut allergies, I am forced to pass up on mouth-watering food every single day of my life. Chocolate? Contains nuts. Cookies? Has traces of nuts. Cake? Manufactured in a facility that processes nuts. And guess what? I got tired of it, so I started tou café (the lowercase makes it chill). The purpose of tou café is to help those with nut allergies easily find cool and delicious recipes.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>No actually, tou café was originally a high school project of mine back when I was really obsessed with the Touken Ranbu/刀剣乱舞 franchise. One of my biggest assignments in my graphic design course was to create a branding for a hypothetical café, so I did what my silly brain of autistic variety did best and made the groundwork for some sort of sword-themed coffee shop. Many years later, and I'm now obsessed with programming silly things and making banana bread.</p>

                    <div class="h3">tou café is dedicated to being 100% nut-free*.</div>

                    <br>
                    <p>SFK is an acronym that stands for "Safe For Kyu" (Kyu being, well, me). Conversely, NSFK stands for "Not Safe For Kyu."</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>It's used to describe food I can eat without dying, so essentially it's a label for any food item that doesn't contain nuts. I think it started off as a joke I made with my friends, but then we ended up using it more and then it stuck.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>*Some "-nuts" are special exceptions, like coconut.</p>

                    <p>Some guy who lives in the void. They made banana bread once and instantly rizzed everyone that ate it. Their disgust for nuts is so absolute that they'd rather choke to death than be in the same room as a cashew.</p>
